Adam: I contributed to the code . I worked on camera. And design of the box for our project 
Caleb: I also contributed to the code for our project. I tested the code to make sure it worked
Triston: Coded and Set up the pir sensor


We had to go through multiple cameras and PIR Sensors to find ones that would work, Had to find to wire PIR sensor, and we had to scrap an idea where the recorded videos would have been emailed to you.
